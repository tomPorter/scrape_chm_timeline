Scrape Computer History Museum "This Day In history"
====================================================

Fetches each day's entries from [http://www.computerhistory.org/tdih/](http://www.computerhistory.org/tdih/) 
and reformats entries as an iCal ics file.

The ics file can be imported into iCal as a separate calendar.  This calendar can be used as a source for 
date entries when building a calendar in iPhoto.

Hints for iPhoto calendars without tears.

- Set the layout for each main photo first.
- Having multiple entries per day means small fonts: Make the font smaller before importing the iCal calendar.
- If you want national holidays, turn them off first, import the calendar, then turn on national holidays.
